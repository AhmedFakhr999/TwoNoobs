- Revision on python 
- after this we try out on provided dataset 
- Review the instruction to do on these dataset
- Final : Visualize the instruction 



Deadline: Tuesday



our first project : 


### **Phase 1: Data Exploration & Cleaning**

1. Load dataset and understand structure
    
2. Handle missing values
    
3. Verify data types and basic statistics
    

### **Phase 2: Core Analysis**

**Income Disparity Analysis:**

- Compare average water access across income groups (High/Upper middle/Lower middle/Low)
    
- Visualize with bar charts
    

**Country Performance Ranking:**

- Identify top 10 and bottom 10 countries for water access
    
- Analyze income patterns among best/worst performers
    

**Urban-Rural Divide:**

- Calculate urban-rural access gaps
    
- Find countries with largest inequalities
    

**Population Impact:**

- Create scatter plot: Population vs Water Access
    
- Identify outliers (large populations with good access, small populations with poor access)
    

### **Phase 3: Key Insights**

Answer these specific questions:

1. **The Rich-Poor Water Gap:** What's the percentage difference in water access between high-income and low-income countries?
    
2. **Urban-Rural Inequality:** Which 3 countries have the largest urban-rural gaps, and how big are these gaps?
    
3. **Population Paradox:** Find one small country with surprisingly poor access and one large country with surprisingly good access.
    

## **Expected Deliverables**

- 4 visualizations (income comparison, rankings, urban-rural gaps, population scatter plot)



### Day 1: Basic Data Exploration

**Tasks:**

1. Calculate average water access by income group
2. Find top 5 and bottom 5 countries
3. Create 3 simple charts:
    - Bar chart: Income groups vs water access
    - Histogram: Distribution of water access
    - Scatter plot: Urban vs Rural access

**Report Output:**

- 1 page summary with 3 charts
- List 3-5 key findings

---

### Day 2: Pattern Analysis

**Tasks:**

1. Calculate urban-rural gap for all countries
2. Group countries by population size (Small/Medium/Large)
3. Compare water access across groups
4. Create 3 charts showing these patterns

**Report Output:**

- 1-2 pages with 3 charts
- Answer: What patterns did you find?

---

### Day 3: Final Report

**Tasks:**

1. Identify 5 best performing countries
2. Identify 5 countries needing most help
3. Calculate population impact if low-access countries improve
4. Create one-page summary with key numbers

**Final Report Structure (4-5 pages):**

1. Executive Summary (0.5 page)
2. Data Overview (Day 1 content)
3. Key Findings (Day 2 content)
4. Insights & Recommendations (Day 3 content)
5. Conclusion (0.5 page)
