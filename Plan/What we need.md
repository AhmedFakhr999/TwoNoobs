- Revision on python 
- after this we try out on provided dataset 
- Review the instruction to do on these dataset
- Final : Visualize the instruction 



Deadline: Tuesday



our first project : 


### **Phase 1: Data Exploration & Cleaning**

1. Load dataset and understand structure
    
2. Handle missing values
    
3. Verify data types and basic statistics
    

### **Phase 2: Core Analysis**

**Income Disparity Analysis:**

- Compare average water access across income groups (High/Upper middle/Lower middle/Low)
    
- Visualize with bar charts
    

**Country Performance Ranking:**

- Identify top 10 and bottom 10 countries for water access
    
- Analyze income patterns among best/worst performers
    

**Urban-Rural Divide:**

- Calculate urban-rural access gaps
    
- Find countries with largest inequalities
    

**Population Impact:**

- Create scatter plot: Population vs Water Access
    
- Identify outliers (large populations with good access, small populations with poor access)
    

### **Phase 3: Key Insights**

Answer these specific questions:

1. **The Rich-Poor Water Gap:** What's the percentage difference in water access between high-income and low-income countries?
    
2. **Urban-Rural Inequality:** Which 3 countries have the largest urban-rural gaps, and how big are these gaps?
    
3. **Population Paradox:** Find one small country with surprisingly poor access and one large country with surprisingly good access.
    

## **Expected Deliverables**

- 4 visualizations (income comparison, rankings, urban-rural gaps, population scatter plot)
